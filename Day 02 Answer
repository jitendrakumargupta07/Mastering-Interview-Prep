Ques 2 . Given an array arr[] of n integers where arr[i] represents the number of chocolates in ith packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that:

Each student gets exactly one packet.
The difference between the maximum and minimum number of chocolates in the packets given to the students is minimized.

Sample:-
Input: arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}, m = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: If we distribute chocolate packets {3, 2, 4}, we will get the minimum difference, that is 2.

Input: arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}, m = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: If we distribute chocolate packets {3, 2, 4, 9, 7}, we will get the minimum difference, that is 9 â€“ 2 = 7.


Answer:
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cout << "Enter number of packets: ";
    cin >> n;
    int arr[n];
    cout << "Enter number of chocolates in each packet: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }
    cout << "Enter number of students: ";
    cin >> m;

    if (m > n) {
        cout << "Not enough packets for students." << endl;
        return 0;
    }

    sort(arr, arr + n);
    int minDiff = INT_MAX;

    for (int i = 0; i + m - 1 < n; i++) {
        int diff = arr[i + m - 1] - arr[i];
        if (diff < minDiff) {
            minDiff = diff;
        }
    }

    cout << "Minimum difference is: " << minDiff << endl;
    return 0;
}
